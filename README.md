# programming-semester-2

My second semester as maven project. The commit from May 3rd, 2019 [see here, Commit 3c85ff2](https://github.com/Phape/programming-semester-2/commit/3c85ff272b9740e1069d5010a8adba0a41012a08) was the initial commit of this repository.
Previously, I had my code in an other repo, which didn't use maven. Today July 7th, 2020 I merged the old repo into this one to have the history.
I used this tutorial: [msrose/combining-git-repositories.md](https://gist.github.com/msrose/2feacb303035d11d2d05)
